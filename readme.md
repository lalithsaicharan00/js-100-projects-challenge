# 100 JavaScript Projects Challenge

Welcome to my **100 JavaScript Projects** repository! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™ve embarked on this journey to **master core (vanilla) JavaScript**, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and boost my confidence as a programmer.

## ðŸ“– About This Challenge

Over **8 weeks**, Iâ€™ll complete **100 hands-on projects**â€”from simple console exercises to interactive web appsâ€”covering **every fundamental JavaScript concept**, including:

- **Syntax, variables & data types**
- **Control flow** (conditionals, loops, functions)
- **Data structures** (arrays, strings, objects, Maps & Sets)
- **Modern ES6+ features** (arrow functions, spread/rest, classes, modules)
- **Asynchronous programming** (callbacks, Promises, `async/await`)
- **DOM manipulation & events**
- **Best practices** (modular code, strict mode, testing)
- **Capstone projects** that integrate everything learned

Each week builds on the last, with **12â€“13 projects/week** that grow in complexity. By the end, Iâ€™ll not only know how to write idiomatic JavaScript, but also have a portfolio of 100 mini-apps and utilities to demonstrate my skills.
